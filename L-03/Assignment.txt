Q1) What is jsx
Ans) Jsx is known as javascript xml. It allows us to write html looking syntax into our javascript files.
You see, when we try to create elements in the dom using React.CreateElement it complicate things. Creating 
one or two html elements is fine but from there on-wards it's going to get very complicated and becomes 
less readable and maintainable. That's why we use JSX. We can create html elements with ease. But we have 
to keep in mind that jsx is not html. Browser doesn't understand jsx. We have a javascript transpiler/compiler
called Babel which is responsible for turning jsx into React.CreateElement() which is a javascript object and
one root.render() method is called these objects are converted into actual html elements and will be inserted 
into dom. In jsx, we can execute any valid javascript expression within the {} braces.

Q2) Explain the advantages of using JSX ? 
Ans) JSX makes development super easy. When we write code using JSX we are basically writing HTML 
like looking code. which is more readable, scalable and maintainable. So, There should be less learning curver
for learning JSX because It is almost similar to html like syntax with minor differences. For example, in html
we write class where as in JSX we write className.
