Certainly! Let me provide a revised analogy considering the clarified points:

When we use a function in the `useState` hook to update a state variable, the component re-renders. 
But what does re-render mean?

For functional components, re-rendering doesn't involve the entire component function being invoked 
again from scratch. Instead, React efficiently updates the user interface by re-running the 
function body to determine the updated JSX. It's like having a dynamic script that selectively 
modifies only the parts of a webpage that need updating.

On the other hand, for class-based components, re-rendering doesn't mean creating a 
new instance of the class. The initial mounting phase creates a new instance, 
but subsequent re-renders update the existing instance based on changes in props or state. 
Think of it like revisiting a room that you've furnished. You might rearrange the furniture 
(update the DOM), but you don't rebuild the entire room (create a new instance of the class).

Now, where do we collect props and create state variables in a class-based component? 
The best place is inside the constructor. Why? Because the constructor is like the blueprint 
for the room, and it's called only once during the initial mounting phase. It's where you set up 
the initial state and gather props, ensuring a solid foundation for your component.



HIERARCHY : Parent component P has two child components C1 & C2. C1 component has two more 
child components a & b. 

Hierarchy : 
PARENT COMPONENT P 
CHILD C1 
a
b
CHILD C2 

Parent constructor -> Parent Render -> C1 constructor -> C1 Render -> a Constructor -> a Render -> 
b Constructor -> b Render -> C2 constructor -> C2 Render -> a componentDidMount -> b componentDidMount 
-> C1 componentDidMount -> C2 componentDidMount -> Parent componentDidMount


The React component lifecycle follows a consistent pattern regardless of the complexity of the component hierarchy. Here's a general overview:

1. Render Phase:
   - React starts with the outermost (parent) component and proceeds to render each component in the 
    hierarchy.
   - The `constructor` and `render` methods are called for each component, from the top-level parent to 
    the innermost child.

2. Mounting Phase:
   - After the render phase is complete, React starts the mounting phase, during which the components 
   are added to the DOM.
   - The `componentDidMount` method is then called for each component, starting from the innermost 
   child and moving outward to the parent.

This pattern ensures that components are rendered and mounted in a hierarchical order, 
from the top-level parent down to the innermost child. The `componentDidMount` method is 
invoked after the mounting is complete for each component.

This consistency allows developers to reason about the lifecycle of components, 
regardless of the complexity of the component hierarchy. It's a fundamental aspect of 
how React manages component rendering and lifecycle events.
